INTRODUCTION

Hi there my name is Muhammad Ahmad.
I have made this Web Scraper using Python Beautiful Soup Library.
It take the top 30 topics from Github page and
then provide each topic Top 20 Repositories along with their Usernames,
Repositories Names and Reposotories Links in a CSV FORMAT.

HOW TO RUN?

I have attached the MAIN FILE.
Unzip this file into a folder then open it.
After opening wait and then you will see the csv files being downloading in 
to your folder.
